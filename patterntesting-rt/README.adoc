PatternTesting Runtime (patterntesting-rt) is the runtime component for the PatternTesting framework.
It provides the annotations and base classes for the PatternTesting testing framework

but can be also used standalone for classpath monitoring or profiling.
It uses AOP and AspectJ to perform this feat.
