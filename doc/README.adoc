The documentation of PatternTesting is based on the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template[Arc42 template].
AsciiDoc was choosen as format for the documentation because it is simple but with enough expressiveness.
And it is another form of source code which you can handle with GIT (or other SCM tools).

Other ideas (and source files) are copied from https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon[dukecon].
Especially the POM and index.adoc files were helpful to set up a working document generation.
