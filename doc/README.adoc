= image:src/main/asciidoc/images/arc42-logo.png[arc42] Documentation

The documentation of PatternTesting is based on the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template[Arc42 template].
AsciiDoc was choosen as format for the documentation because it is simple but with enough expressiveness.
And it is another form of source code which you can handle with GIT (or other SCM tools).

Other ideas (and source files) are copied from https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon[dukecon].
Especially the POM and index.adoc files were helpful to set up a working document generation.
You find the source for documents at:

* link:src/main/asciidoc/de[src/main/asciidoc/de] : German version
* link:src/main/asciidoc/en[src/main/asciidoc/en] : English version
* link:src/main/asciidoc/images[src/main/asciidoc/images] : images

= Release Notes

see link:../CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG]



= Release Checklist

This is a little checklist for the deployment of the next release:

. change to release branch and merge the developer branch
. update the link:../CHANGELOG.md[changelog]
. change the version in pom.xml (remove -SNAPSHOT)
. build all artifacts from patterntesting-parent and deploy it
(`mvn -Prelease -DskipTests clean install source:jar site javadoc:jar gpg:sign -Dgpg.passphrase=xxx deploy`)
. workaround for javadoc-generation if javadoc-JAR in patterntesting-check-ct is empty:
.. `pushd patterntesting-libs/patterntesting-check/patterntesting-check-ct/`
.. `mvn site` (generates the ajdoc reports and copies it to apidoc directory)
.. `mvn javadoc:jar`
.. `popd`
. after successful deployment go to https://central.sonatype.com/publishing and _publish_ the deployment
. optional: generate the website with `mvn -Plocal-site site-deploy` (but patterntesting.org is no longer available)
. commit the changes (if not already done) and label the sources, e.g. with patterntesting-2.6.0
. go to https://github.com/oboehm/PatternTesting2/releases[Releases] and _Draft a new release_
. provide the jar files for normal download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/patterntesting/files/[SourceForge]:
.. login to https://sourceforge.net/auth/[Sourceforge]
.. select https://sourceforge.net/projects/patterntesting/files/[patterntesting/files] and upload the tar and zip files from patterntesting-libs, patterntesting-tools and patterntesting-samples (you can find it in the target directory).
. close https://github.com/oboehm/PatternTesting2/issues[issues] (if not already done)
. merge the release branch to master and develop branch
. change to develop branch and start next SNAPSHOT
. after a few days: check patterntesting with http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cpatterntesting[search.maven.org] if the new version was automatically distributed
