= image:src/main/asciidoc/images/arc42-logo.png[arc42] Documentation

The documentation of PatternTesting is based on the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template[Arc42 template].
AsciiDoc was choosen as format for the documentation because it is simple but with enough expressiveness.
And it is another form of source code which you can handle with GIT (or other SCM tools).

Other ideas (and source files) are copied from https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon[dukecon].
Especially the POM and index.adoc files were helpful to set up a working document generation.
You find the source for documents at:

* link:src/main/asciidoc/de[src/main/asciidoc/de] : German version
* link:src/main/asciidoc/en[src/main/asciidoc/en] : English version
* link:src/main/asciidoc/images[src/main/asciidoc/images] : images

= Release Notes

see link:../CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG]



= Release Checklist

This is a little checklist for the deployment of the next release:

. change to release branch and merge the developer branch
. update the link:../CHANGELOG.md[changelog]
. change the version in pom.xml (remove -SNAPSHOT)
. build all artifacts from patterntesting-parent
(`mvn -DskipTests -B clean install javadoc:jar gpg:sign -Dgpg.passphrase=xx`)
. workaround for javadoc-generation if javadoc-JAR in patterntesting-check-ct is empty:
.. `pushd patterntesting-libs/patterntesting-check/patterntesting-check-ct/`
.. `mvn site` (generates the ajdoc reports and copies it to apidoc directory)
.. `mvn javadoc:jar`
.. `popd`
. use the script `src/script/deploy.sh` to upload bundles to https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org] (but don't forget to update the VERSION variable inside this script).
If one of the signed bundles fail, check the signature (e.g. `gpg --verify patterntesting-libs-2.5.1-bin.tar.gz.asc`).
If signature is wrong, sign it manually, e.g. gpg -ba patterntesting-libs-2.5.1-bin.tar.gz and bundle it again (`mvn repository:bundle-create or manually`) or remove the assembled zip file from the bundle
. after upload to  https://oss.sonatype.org/[Sonatype]:
select https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories[Staging Repositories] on oss.sonatype.org, press "Refresh" and then "Close" and "Release".
. generate the website with `mvn -Plocal-site site-deploy` and copy it to http://patterntesting.org/release/[patterntesting.org/release/]
. commit the changes (if not already done) and label the sources, e.g. with patterntesting-2.5.1
. provide the jar files for normal download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/patterntesting/files/[SourceForge]:
.. login to https://sourceforge.net/auth/[Sourceforge]
.. select https://sourceforge.net/projects/patterntesting/files/[patterntesting/files] and upload the tar and zip files from patterntesting-libs, patterntesting-tools and patterntesting-samples (you can find it in the target directory).
. close https://github.com/oboehm/PatternTesting2/issues[issues] (if not already done)
. after a few days: check patterntesting with http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cpatterntesting[search.maven.org] if the new version was automatically distributed
