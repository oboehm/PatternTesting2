= What Is patterntesting-check-ct?

PatternTesting Check.CT (patterntesting-check-ct) is a quality framework that allows to automatically verify that Architecture/Design recommendations are implemented correctly in the code.
It provides different checks of known anti patterns (like using System.out for logging) but provides also a test framework for better testing.
The checks are done during compile time (this is the "CT" in Check.CT").
