      PatternTesting is a testing framework that allows to automatically
      verify that Architecture/Design/Best practices recommendations are
      implemented correctly in the code. It uses AOP and AspectJ to
      perform this feat. Read the
      <a href="whatis.html">What is Pattern Testing </a> page for more
      details.

        To be the Minesweeper of Your Java Code!
      </p>
      <subsection name="What does this mean?">
        <p>
          Do you known the computer game "minesweeper"?
          There you have to find the mines in a field.
          If you are not careful and hit a field with a mine
          the game is over.
        </p>
        <p>
          PatternTesting is not a game but it gives you hints where there may be
          mines in your software. It is up to you to remove the mines
          before they explode at the users of your application or damage your
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the mines in your code before your users will find them.
          Otherwise: GAME OVER!

        Errors in code can be annoying. Especially when they pop up in
        production and you realize that this kind of error could be have
        been prevented.
        There are <a href="http://patterntesting.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AntiPattern">antipatterns</a>
        known in the internet which describes the cause of such errors and
        what you can to to prevent them.
        PatternTesting helps you to detect some common
        <a href="http://patterntesting.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/AntiPattern">antipatterns</a> and violation of
        common practices.
