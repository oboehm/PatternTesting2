= What Is patterntesting-compat?


In patterntesting-compat you will find classes, which are out-dated.
Reasons for that are:

* the class or interface are replaced by a newer class
* the class was changed but the change is no longer compatible to a previous version

Normally you don't need this module.
You only needed it if you have a dependency to a deprecated class.
