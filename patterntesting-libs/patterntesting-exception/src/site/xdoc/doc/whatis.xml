      <p>
        If you want to do exception handling correct this is a hard job.
        PatternTesting-Exception wants to help you to do this job.
        For this reason this AspectJ library provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          better exception handling (it wraps some common exception like
          IOException and replaces the error message by a more helpful one,
          e.g. which file is missing with a FileNotFoundException).)
        </li>
        <li>
          Test support for exception handling (via ExceptionFactory and
          @TestException annotation)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="History">
      <p>
      	In a previous version the exception support was distributed over
      	several sub projects (patterntesting-rt and patterntesting-check).
