      <p>
        Concurrency will become more and more important in the future.
        PatternTesting has some support for concurrency but has also
        have support for testing threads.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Thread support: you can mark your methods as <code>@Sychronized</code>
          which has the advantage that the lock classes from
          <code>java.util.concurrent</code> will be used. This allows
          you more flexibility than the <code>synchronized</code> keyword.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="History">
      <p>
      	In a previous version support for concurrency was distributed over
      	several sub projects (patterntesting-rt and patterntesting-check).
