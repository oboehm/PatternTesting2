        Every project defines a set of rules that all (or most :-)) developers 
        agree on. These rules can be coding conventions, naming conventions or
        at a higher level architecture decisions or best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Usually these rules are either mentioned verbally or written in a 
      	"Developer Guide" (I am personnally using an internal Wiki
      	web site for sharing this best practices knowledge). However, it is
      	not enough. How am I going to verify that I have properly coded 
      	against these rules?
      </p>
      <p>
      	So far, there was only one solution: code review. Be it continuously
      	with Pair programming or at some point in time with tech leads or 
      	peers performing the review. Wouldn't it be nice if I could have a
      	suite of tests that could automatically check this? In the same 
      	spirit a JUnit test suite verifies that code does what it is expected
      	to do. But this time, we would check that not only the code does what
      	it is supposed to do but also that it does it the way we have defined
      	it!
      </p>
      <p>
      	There are several tools available to check coding and naming
        conventions (See the <a href="resources.html">Resource</a> section),
        but there are none to perform architecture/design best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... until now ....
      </p>
      <p>
      	PatternTesting Check is about providing the means to
      	<strong>automatically</strong> check for 
      	Architecture/Design/Implementation decisions.
      	PatternTesting Check.RT is the runtime part of it.

    <section name="Some examples">

      <p>
      	Here are some examples of automated checks that the
      	PatternTesting-Check.RT framework allows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Verify that no calls to any method in our application is allowed 
          to use <code>null</code>,
        </li>
        <li>
          Verify that no method returns <code>null</code> in our application,
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      	The power is almost endless...
